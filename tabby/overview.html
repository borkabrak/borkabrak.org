<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
Tabby is designed to simplify the creation of tab set navigation.  All you do
is tell Tabby what tabs you want and where to find their content.  
</p>

<p>
This is an example of Tabby at work right now.  Each tab's content is provided
by its own url, which can live anywhere an AJAX call can reach.  We're
not limited to flat HTML, either.  If you like PHP or Perl scripts, that's
fine -- Tabby just hits the url you give it and displays the result.
<p>
Tabby requires jQuery.  It was developed under jQuery 1.4.2.  It will likely work for
prior versions, but I make no guarantees.
