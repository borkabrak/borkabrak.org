  <h1>Birdy's Turning Thirty!</h1>

  <p>
  There's a party Saturday, and you're all invited!  If you need to know a
  time to show up, let's say.. oh.. 6:00-7:00 or so.
  </p>

  <p>
  Some have asked me about gift ideas.  Here's a list of suggestions, for
  those who are interested.  I'll update this if/as I think of more ideas,
  so feel free to check back here as the time proceeds.  If I need to remove
  something from the list, or you have any info you want me to put up here,
  email me at <a href="mailto:borkabrak@gmail.org">borkabrak@gmail.com</a> or
  text me at 615.293.9673.  Or call.  I keep forgetting that thing also does
  voice..  :)
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Oh, and feel free to share this page with anyone you think needs to see it.
  I trust you all.  Pretty much anyone is invited who knows where the House is,
  or is known by someone who does.

  originally sending this out.

  (Also, apologies for the late hour I first texted -- I wasn't thinking)

      <li><h4>Gift certificates!</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
            Any fabric shop.  <strong>Especially</strong> 
            <a href="http://www.textilefabricstore.com/public_html/">Textile Fabrics</a> 
            on Franklin Road, thought that may be a trifle pricy.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            <a href="http://www.599fashion.com">599fashion.com</a> This is
            like Overstock for clothes.  Everything costs $5.99, and they have
            some awesome stuff.  A gift certificate from here is
            great, or just buy something from the site!
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      Always appreciated are party facilitators such as beer, munchies, or
      whatever else you think might help.
